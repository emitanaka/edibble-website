To use the system, you will need to install the free, open-source programming language [R](https://www.r-project.org/) [If you would like to read more R, I recommend that you check out the [R for data science community](https://www.rfordatasci.com/).]{.aside} and install the package:\n\n```r\ninstall.packages(\"edibble\")\n```\n\nor you can install the developmental version with:\n\n```r\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"emitanaka/edibble\")\n```\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(edibble)\ndesign(\"My first experiment\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nMy first experiment\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(edibble)\ndesign(\"My first experiment\") %>% \n  set_units(plant = 10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nMy first experiment\n└─plant (10 levels)\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
