The `edibble` system is an R-package to build a design of an experiment. To use the system, you will need to install the free, open-source programming language [R](https://www.r-project.org/) [If you would like to read more R, I recommend that you check out the [R for data science community](https://www.rfordatasci.com/).]{.aside} and install the package:

```r
install.packages("edibble")
```

or you can install the developmental version with:

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("emitanaka/edibble")
```


```{r}
library(edibble)
design() %>% 
  set_units(unit = 10)
```
