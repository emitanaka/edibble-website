Detailed descriptions are provided in Williams et al. (2021) and I only provide a redacted version in this blog.\nFirst, I load the package needed. The edibble package is currently available on GitHub at https://github.com/emitanaka/edibble – I am planning to submit this package on CRAN in the next couple of months.\nThere are three types of sensory discrimination tests that are used by sensory scientists Drs Ciarán Forde and Patrick O’Riordan in an experiment to see if a story about an alternative to vegemite could sharpen the taste buds and improve the discriminative abilities of Australian consumers. THe three sensory discrimination tests are as described below in Williams et al. (2021):\nThese test are abbreviated as T, PP, and M, respectively. The experimental structure is briefly summarised below:\nThe following is the experimental design description in Williams et al. (2021):"
